# AGOXA Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 2026

## Overview

AGOXA is a browser-based file sharing extension designed to enable short-lived, QR-code–based file transfer between a desktop browser and a secondary device. User privacy and data minimization are core design principles of AGOXA.

This Privacy Policy explains what data AGOXA handles and how that data is used.

---

## Data Collection

AGOXA does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information.

Specifically, AGOXA does **not** collect:
- Names, email addresses, phone numbers, or identification details
- Authentication credentials such as passwords or PINs
- Financial or payment information
- Health-related data
- Location data including IP address or GPS coordinates
- Browsing history or website activity
- User behavior tracking such as clicks, keystrokes, or mouse movement

---

## File Handling

Files are processed **only when explicitly selected by the user** for a file transfer session.

- Files are transferred through a temporary, session-based mechanism
- Files are not retained after the transfer completes
- Files are not indexed, analyzed, or shared
- AGOXA does not access files without direct user interaction

---

## Data Storage

AGOXA may temporarily store non-personal session information such as:
- Session identifiers
- Transfer mode state (send or receive)

This information exists only for the duration of an active transfer session and is automatically cleared once the session ends.

---

## Data Sharing

AGOXA does **not** sell, share, or transfer user data to third parties.

No data is used for:
- Advertising
- Analytics
- Profiling
- Creditworthiness evaluation
- Lending or financial assessment

---

## Permissions Usage

AGOXA requests only the minimum permissions required to support its single purpose of QR-based file transfer:
- Storage permissions are used solely for temporary session state
- Download permissions are used only when the user initiates a file download
- Host permissions are limited to a local interface used for file transfer

No permissions are used to monitor browsing activity or modify web content.

---

## Remote Code

AGOXA does not use remote code.

All scripts and logic are bundled within the extension package. The extension does not load external JavaScript, execute dynamically evaluated code, or use remote modules.

---

## Security

AGOXA uses temporary, short-lived sessions to reduce data exposure. Sessions automatically expire and are destroyed after file transfer completion, ensuring minimal risk of unauthorized access.

---

## Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect improvements or changes in functionality. Any updates will be published at the same URL.
