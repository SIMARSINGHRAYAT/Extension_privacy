# Privacy Policy for ScholarZO

ScholarZO is a browser extension designed to help users view, organize, and track publications from a public Google Scholar profile. This Privacy Policy explains how ScholarZO handles data and protects user privacy.

ScholarZO does not collect, store, transmit, sell, or share personal user data. The extension works only with publicly available information from Google Scholar profiles that users explicitly choose to access by providing a public Google Scholar Profile ID.

The extension retrieves publication metadata that is publicly visible on Google Scholar, such as publication titles, authors, publication year, venue, citation count, and publication links. This information is used solely to display and organize publications within the extension interface.

All retrieved publication data is stored locally within the user’s browser using the browser’s storage system. This data never leaves the user’s device and is not transmitted to any external servers or third parties.

ScholarZO does not require users to create an account, sign in, or provide personal details such as name, email address, location, or credentials. The extension does not track browsing behavior, monitor user activity, or collect analytics.

ScholarZO uses browser notifications only to inform users when a new publication is detected on their public Google Scholar profile. These notifications are purely informational and are directly related to the extension’s core functionality.

ScholarZO does not use remote code. All JavaScript, HTML, and CSS required for the extension to function are bundled directly within the extension package and executed locally in the user’s browser.

ScholarZO works only with public Google Scholar profiles. Private or restricted profiles cannot be accessed. Google Scholar is a third-party service and is not affiliated with ScholarZO.

This Privacy Policy may be updated if the extension’s functionality changes. Any updates will be reflected on this page.

If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you may contact the developer through the support channel listed on the Chrome Web Store page.
