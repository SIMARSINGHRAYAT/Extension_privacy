Privacy Policy for Pastezo

Pastezo is a Chrome extension designed to help users save, manage, and reuse text snippets locally within their browser. User privacy and data security are core principles of Pastezo’s design.

Pastezo does not collect, transmit, sell, or share any personal or sensitive user data. All data created or stored by the user, including saved text snippets and related metadata, is stored locally using Chrome’s built-in storage system on the user’s device. This data never leaves the user’s browser and is not accessible to the developer or any third party.

Pastezo does not use remote servers, analytics services, tracking technologies, or advertising networks. The extension does not monitor browsing activity, keystrokes, clipboard content in the background, or user behavior outside of direct, user-initiated actions. Clipboard access, when used, occurs only as a result of explicit user interaction, such as copying or pasting text within the extension.

Pastezo does not require account creation, does not request personal identification information, and does not collect information such as names, email addresses, IP addresses, or location data. All functionality is performed locally within the browser environment.

Users remain in full control of their data at all times. Saved content can be edited, deleted, cleared, or exported by the user whenever they choose. Removing the extension from Chrome permanently deletes all locally stored data associated with Pastezo.

This privacy policy applies solely to the Pastezo Chrome extension and may be updated if the extension’s functionality changes. Any updates will continue to prioritize user privacy and transparency.

If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, you may contact the developer through the Chrome Web Store listing.
