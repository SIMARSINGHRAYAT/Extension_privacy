Privacy Policy for Scholar Ref

Last updated: [add date]

Scholar Ref is a browser extension designed to generate APA 7th edition academic citations from Google Scholar. Protecting user privacy is a core principle of this extension.

Data Collection

Scholar Ref does not collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal user data.

The extension does not collect:

Personal identification information

Browsing history outside Google Scholar

Search history

Login credentials

IP addresses

User-generated documents or files

Website Access

Scholar Ref accesses Google Scholar pages solely to extract bibliographic metadata (such as author names, publication year, title, and source) required to generate APA 7th edition citations. This data is processed locally within the user’s browser and is not transmitted to any external server.

Data Storage

The extension may use local browser storage to save minimal, non-personal settings related to extension behavior (such as user preferences). No academic content, personal data, or identifiable information is stored persistently.

Clipboard Access

Scholar Ref writes citation text to the clipboard only when explicitly initiated by the user (e.g., clicking a “Copy APA Citation” button). Clipboard access is not used for reading data or for any background activity.

Third-Party Services

Scholar Ref does not integrate with third-party analytics tools, advertising networks, trackers, or external APIs. The extension does not use remote code or externally hosted scripts.

Data Sharing

Scholar Ref does not share any data with third parties. All processing occurs locally in the browser.

Security

All extension logic is bundled within the extension package and follows Chrome Web Store security requirements. No dynamic code execution, remote scripts, or unsafe evaluation methods are used.

Changes to This Policy

If changes are made to this privacy policy, the updated version will be provided with the extension listing or associated webpage.

Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy or the extension, you may contact the developer via the Chrome Web Store listing.
