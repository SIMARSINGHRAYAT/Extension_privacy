Privacy Policy for LinkZo

LinkZo is designed with privacy as a core principle. The extension does not collect, transmit, or share any personal or sensitive user data.

All information handled by LinkZo consists solely of website URLs and optional custom names that the user explicitly chooses to save. This data is stored locally within the user’s browser using the browser’s built-in storage system. The stored data never leaves the user’s device and is not transmitted to any external servers or third parties.

LinkZo does not use analytics, tracking technologies, cookies, advertising identifiers, or profiling mechanisms. The extension does not monitor browsing activity, read webpage content, or access data from open tabs beyond opening a user-selected URL when explicitly requested by the user.

No user accounts, registrations, or authentication systems are required to use LinkZo. The extension does not collect names, email addresses, IP addresses, location data, or any other personally identifiable information.

LinkZo does not execute or load remote code. All scripts and resources required for the extension are bundled directly within the extension package, ensuring predictable and secure behavior.

User data stored by LinkZo remains under the full control of the user and can be modified or deleted at any time through the extension interface or by uninstalling the extension, which removes all locally stored data.

By using LinkZo, users can be confident that their data remains private, local, and fully under their control.
